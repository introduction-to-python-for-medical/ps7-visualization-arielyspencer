in addition to the commentary done in the python file i have created a 2,2
table of graphs for the values of 

skin:mass
age:preg
insulin:skin
insulin:plasma

these are the values that gave me the highest correlation on the correlation
heat map

in all but the age:preg graph we see a lot of values at x = 0. this is likely
due to missing data or data accidently inputed as 0 or possibly data that is 
actually 0.

in both mass:skin and insulin:plas we can see an almost obvious correlation

in the former this is probably due to the fact that the more fat you have
(higher bmi) the more skin fold thickness you have

in the latter -according to online sources- there is a correlation between
plasma glucose concentration and insulin levels - they both work on glucose

for skin:insu there does not seem to be an obvious visual relationship using the scatter plot

for preg:age we see that there are obvious jumps up in the y values - this 
would be because you cannot have a half pregnancy. In addition we can see a 
slight rise in the number of pregnancies in correlation to age. This graph 
is not perfect however we are very unlikely to see a woman giving more than 10 
births at the age of 20.
